                    <p >Most of us used to have a day with a clear routine and a well-organized life. We looked forward to going to work every day, met up with friends, had vacation plans, and got on with our lives. Tips, tricks, and techniques scattered all over the internet taught us how to draw clear boundaries between work and personal life and how to grow on all levels. We knew how to organize and balance our time: set personal goals, manage time, switch off from work, and take care of ourselves.</p>
                    <p>But a year into the pandemic, our daily routine and understanding of the ideal day has dissolved. Time has become amorphous. We feel like we're spending our time inefficiently, and we give ourselves a strange ultimatum: go back to the old routine, or if I can't, I'll wait until everything is back to normal and watch whatever I can on Netflix until then. We are understandably upset and lost. It wasn't our choice to leave our old, balanced lives.</p>
                    <h3>Discover new normal</h3>
                    <p>By now we have come to terms with this new reality and some have even returned to their normal lives. But things are not as they were before. Now that we know what to expect from the pandemic, our new routine is still quite uncertain. Depending on where we are, we either have a certain social life or a travel ban, and we don't feel too secure about our future. Given the nature of our new reality, it's hard to be happy. We all want to see a bright future, or at least understand what the new normal is.</p>
                    <p>With a few tips and a little organizational help, we can seize the opportunity to improve our days, even without a scary overhaul of our life goals. We can turn our inefficient use of time into an organized day by doing many more enjoyable and meaningful activities. While you may not be able to control what's going on in the world right now, you can do your part to make your day more enjoyable and balanced.</p>
                    <h3>Think about your current day</h3>
                    <p>Most of us perform two types of daily activities. The primary activities are permanent activities, typically associated with work or home. The so-called leisure activities are temporary and are done for a specific period of time to spend time with family, pursue a hobby, meet with friends, or make plans for the future. Both types of activities are interrelated and together fill your days, weeks, and years.</p>
                    <p>Take a moment and think about what your ideal day might look like. Is it full of work interactions and building plans for the future? Possibly it is about "free time" where you spend most of your spare time reading books, watching movies, and playing video games? Do you think your ideal day is the one that challenges you to live your best life? Does it provide energy for encouragement and personal growth? There is no right or wrong answer, as long as you are happy about it.</p>
                    <p>Now analyze what your day currently looks like. If you find the time to do all the activities you would like to do, then you can congratulate yourself. You are on the right track! However, if you feel that you lack the time to pursue all the things that you would like to do, then start organizing your day. There is certainly room for a more productive and balanced day.</p>
                    <h3>Make a list of your daily activities</h3>
                    <p>It's time to make a list of all your daily activities. Try grouping them into categories, such as work, home, hobbies, leisure, etc. Include everything, without limiting yourself to what you think is important and takes up your attention and time.</p>
                    <h3>Analyze your activities</h3>
                    <p>Now that you have a list of all your activities, go through it carefully. Ask yourself, why are you doing these things? What is the real purpose of these activities? Are these activities meaningful? Undoubtedly, you do some things to help pay your bills. You spend time cooking so you can have a delicious meal. You exercise to be healthy. The purpose can be as small as learning something new today. But without a purpose, activities are just pointless time wasters. We only live once, and our days should make us happy and help us live a meaningful life!</p>
                    <p>So go through your list. See if there are any activities that are just time-wasters without adding any real value. Highlight them with a different color.</p>
                    <h3>Fill your day with a purpose</h3>
                    <p>After you have listed all the activities and marked the pointless ones, cross them off the list. Now you have time in your daily agenda to pursue something you haven't had time to do before. Maybe you've always wanted to remodel your house, so you can take a design class. Or maybe you've wanted to write a blog, so now you have time to start. If you're thinking about changing jobs but you're lacking certain skills, now's the time to start a new course. And that will get you closer to your goal. Or get your books and photos in order, or plan a next trip.</p>
                    <p>Just turn on your growth mindset and fill your day with new purposeful activities. Now you have time to engage in the activities that bring you closer to your ideal day. Step by step, you'll get closer to your balanced life.  </p>
                    <h3>Enjoy your perfect day</h3>
                    <p>Although a year in the pandemic has opened up a lot of free time for many of us, it often lacks meaningful content. Be aware that your ideal day is your own choice. It does not depend on your age, gender, or profession. It is a privilege for you to have one that you enjoy. Do your best to organize your activities and you will begin to have not only happier days, but days that let you live your life to the fullest.</p>
